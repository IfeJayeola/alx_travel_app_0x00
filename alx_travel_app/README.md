# ALX Travel App (0x00)

A Django-based travel listings API project built as part of the ALX backend engineering journey.  
This repository includes models, serializers, seeders, and commands to populate the initial dataset.

## Overview

This project implements a backend for travel listings. It allows you to define travel-related models such as destinations and listings, serialize those models into JSON for API endpoints, and seed the database with initial data using a custom management command. The goal is to provide a foundation for a travel app‚Äôs backend ‚Äî serving endpoints for travel offers, destinations, and more.

## Features

- Django ORM models for travel entities  
- REST-style serializers  
- Custom ‚Äúseed‚Äù command to populate the database with starter data  
- SQLite (default) for quick setup  
- Easily extensible to support authentication, filters, or more advanced endpoints  

## Tech Stack

- **Python** (3.8+)  
- **Django**  
- **Django REST Framework** *(if enabled)*  
- **SQLite** by default (can be replaced with PostgreSQL or another database)  

## Project Structure
- **alx_travel_app/**: Project settings and URL configs  
- **listings/**: Models, serializers, views, and seeding logic  
- **manage.py**: Entry point for Django commands  
- **requirement.txt**: Project dependencies
